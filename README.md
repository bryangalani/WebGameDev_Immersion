# A Week Web Game Development Immersion

A week web game development immersion provided by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-gamedev-javascript).
This course taught how to create an small 2D endless run game mainly using JavaScript with the support of HTML, CSS and JSON. This course uses the library P5.JS and some additional scripts to support the P5.js library such as AJAX add Collision 2D.

The editor used by Alura was the **[p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org)**. The code in this editor can be accessed **[HERE](https://editor.p5js.org/alura/sketches/OWs4v-4vC)**.
In my case, I used the **Visual Studio Code** editor combined with **WAMP**.
